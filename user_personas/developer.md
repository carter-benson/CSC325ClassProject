# Persona 2: Developer #

**Name:** Jamie Wong  
**Role:** Backend Developer  
**Demographics:** 34 years old, Male, San Francisco, CA  

### Goals and Motivations ###
- Ensures the software is stable, scalable, and performs well under high traffic.
- Wants clear documentation and a streamlined deployment process.
- Values constructive feedback from end users to improve functionality.

### Challenges and Pain Points ###
- Frequently deals with ambiguous bug reports that lack reproduction steps.
- Struggles with balancing feature development with necessary maintenance and bug fixes.
- Encounters difficulties when non-technical stakeholders request unrealistic deadlines.

### Example Scenario ###
Jamie is assigned to fix a critical performance bug that users have been complaining about. While investigating, he realizes that the root cause is a poorly optimized database query introduced in the last update. He needs to refactor the query without affecting other dependencies. Meanwhile, the product team pressures him to also add a new feature in the same release, forcing him to negotiate deadlines and explain technical constraints.
