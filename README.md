# Project Overview #

This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of key stakeholders interacting with our software. By creating detailed user personas, stakeholders can better understand their needs, challenges, and expectations. These personas help guide design and development decisions, ensuring that the software aligns with the goals of its users.

### Included Personas ###

The project includes three primary personas:

1. **End User:** A customer support representative who interacts with the software daily.
2. **Developer:** A backend developer responsible for maintaining and improving the software.
3. **Owner:** A CEO & product owner making strategic business decisions.
