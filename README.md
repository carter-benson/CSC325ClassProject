# Online Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on building a personal website portfolio for an undergraduate computer science student. The website should showcase the student’s skills, projects, and experiences, establishing a professional online presence and enhancing career opportunities. By effectively demonstrating technical abilities and creativity, the portfolio will serve as a platform for networking and attracting potential employers.

## Objectives

The portfolio should be designed to demonstrate the student’s technical proficiency, highlighting skills in programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It will effectively present completed projects, internships, and relevant coursework in an engaging way, while also building a professional online presence.

## Features and Expected Outcomes

The website should include various sections such as a homepage, an about me section with educational background and a downloadable resume, a portfolio of projects with detailed descriptions and source code links, a list of technical skills, and a contact form for professional inquiries. By effectively organizing these sections, the portfolio will create a visually appealing and functional user experience. This is expected to enhance the student’s online presence, leading to increased opportunities for internships and job offers.
